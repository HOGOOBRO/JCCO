<h2>FOR STARTUPS 어떻게 할 것인가?</h2>
<a><strong><u>POUR YOUR HEART INTO IT.</u></strong></a>
<p>How coulud we make our company successful<strong>(JCCO)</strong>?
A company can grow big without losing the passion and personality that built it, but only if it's driven not by profits but by values and by people.</p>
<img src="presentation.jpg" width="100%">
<p>The key is heart. I pour my heart into every device, and so do my partners at JCCO. When customers sense that, they respond in kind.
If you pour your heart into your work, or into any worthy enterprise, you can achieve dreams others may think impossible. That's what makes life rewarding.</p>
